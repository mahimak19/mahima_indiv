### 5.1 Beneficial + Harmful effects of Computing


Drones: Fun, easy, but can be used by military

Dopamine: Pleasure hormones, video games and social media can be addictive, constant excitement from them.

Imperative: sequencing, different decisions, like python


## Actions:
1) Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial Effects of Computing: Access to a larger range of information and experiences (like video games, online websites and articles), ability to streamline certain tasks to make them easier, help and connect to people across a large distance (like across the world) and learn about their culture

Harmful effects: Can be addictive (dopamine effect, Internet can be a distraction), Privacy issues can occur, Technology and AI can replace jobs done by humans (unemployment, loss of livelihood).

2) Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

The dopamine problem is real. As teenagers, we constantly try to keep our minds busy with distractions like social media, tv/movies, etc, and it is easy to get addicted to these things. These short term pleasures give instant hits of dopamine, which can impact long-term goals like studying and extracurriculars. For me, scrolling on YouTube is a big distraction from completing my work in a timely manner.
