# TPT Notes

## 5.6 Safe Computing
-Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
In our greet pages, people entered their names into the form and the program returned a greeting. In our sign up form for our personality parlor site, the name, email address and phone number were recorded into a spreadsheet, which is PII.

-What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
I think that certain PII is okay to be revealed, like name and email address. However, other PII like home address, phone number and names of family members are more personal, and shouldn't be given out loosely.

-Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication.
A bad password is using common words of phrases or sequential numbers or letters, since they can easily be figured out. A good password is using combined random words, letters, numbers and special characters to create a unique password that is hard to hack. Two-factor is ideal.

-Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Symmetric encryption is where there is only one key or code that is used to both encrypt and decrypt secret information. Asymmetric encryption is when a public key is used to encrypt a message or data, then a private key is used to decrypt it.

-Provide and example of encryption we used in deployment.
We opened internet ports in order to host the website, but a special network password is required to view the site from the raspberry pi. 

-Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques
One phishing scheme I have experienced is when I got a call about the expired warranty on my vehicle, even though I have no vehicle. They wanted my insurance information, which I also did not have.


## 5.5 Legal and Ethical Concerns

-When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.

    -Types of License
	-Creative Commons: waives copyright interest in a work you’ve created and dedicates it to world public domain
	-MIT License: allows to give away your software but they have to acknowledge you
	-GPL License: More communist, you are free to give away, but others have to give away code for free too

-Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
   We picked the MIT license because we want other people to be able to utilize our code and build their own projects, but they just have to give us credit. With this license, other people recognize us for our work but they can still use our code to build unique things.
   



## 5.4

- CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
San Diego is home to a lot of different types of birds. One crowdsource idea would be to ask all students to report and take pictures of any bird sightings near where they are and upload it to a database. Then, the data could be interpreted and a list of all different bird species could be published.

- What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
Yes. Our final CSP project that provides tools for college students could benefit with crowdsourcing. We could take input from many different stduents on what tools might be helpful for college students, based on their own opinions or their older siblings.




## 5.3 
-Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
No.
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
The programs were probably designed according to the majority of people in the country, who are white. More AI or machine learning is required to address all people.

-How do you think this happened?
The company probably designed the algorithm with contrasting features in mind, and the computer was designed to detect faces in bright light. However, for people of color, those features are not present and the computer couldn't detect darker skin tones.

-Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
Yes. It disproportionately impacts people of color and make them feel excluded. However, it was not done purposely.

-Should it be corrected?
Yes. Algorithms and tech in general can always be improved to fit other demographics.


-What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
Fix the algorithm to detect many different facial features, train the cameras to detect darker skin tones, and focus on facial features that are common to all humans.









## 5.2 Digital Divide 

-Lack of access to technology in poorer areas, less developed areas. 
-Demographics, geo location, socioeconomic factors
-Can’t get latest updates, Amish choose not to use tech
-PUSD is making people use chromebooks, can impede digital expoloration and flexibility

### Actions:

How does someone empower themself in a digital world?

Create programs and content that serves a purpose in society. A creation that helps people and changes lives. Connecting with other people and sharing ideas digitally is also another way to empower oneself.

How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.

People that don't have access to technology may not be able to digitally empower themselves. One thing that empowered people can do is help supply technology to those in poorer areas, as well as educate them on how to use it and accomplish different tasks. One can also offer coding classes to underprivileged people so that even they can create and contribute to the technological world. Something I could do at DNHS is reach out to students who have internet and tech access issues at home and introduce them to computer science and what it has to offer.

Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?

Many classes still use traditional textbooks and notebooks to learn material, and it may not be as accessible or feasible to do this. For example, some classes only have the textbook at school and students have to be at school to learn the material. Students also have to carry large notebooks for some classes, where instead most work can be done online. Access to information is expanded drastically by using the internet too, which some classes may not allow. Also, Del Norte wifi blocks certain sites even though there's nothing bad in them.















## 5.1 Beneficial + Harmful effects of Computing


Drones: Fun, easy, but can be used by military

Dopamine: Pleasure hormones, video games and social media can be addictive, constant excitement from them.

Imperative: sequencing, different decisions, like python


### Actions:
1) Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing

Beneficial Effects of Computing: Access to a larger range of information and experiences (like video games, online websites and articles), ability to streamline certain tasks to make them easier, help and connect to people across a large distance (like across the world) and learn about their culture

Harmful effects: Can be addictive (dopamine effect, Internet can be a distraction), Privacy issues can occur, Technology and AI can replace jobs done by humans (unemployment, loss of livelihood).

2) Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?

The dopamine problem is real. As teenagers, we constantly try to keep our minds busy with distractions like social media, tv/movies, etc, and it is easy to get addicted to these things. These short term pleasures give instant hits of dopamine, which can impact long-term goals like studying and extracurriculars. For me, scrolling on YouTube is a big distraction from completing my work in a timely manner.
